# KNN-Classifier-Implementation-and-Optimization
    Implemented KNN algorithm using Python and NumPy, Conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of different k values and distance metrics on classification accuracy.
    Analyzed the influence of Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distance measures on classification accuracy. Achieved the highest accuracy of 82.64% using the Manhattan distance metric.
